# auto-embed-yt

I don´t like sharing things on youtube, because if, like my mother, you don´t have a google account, you need to scroll down and click stuff, before going to the thing I want to share.
This page fixes that, by automatically embedding the video.
It also has no adds. It also uses privacy mode.
I just copy the embed code from youtube itself, so it´s not illegal :)

Go her to try: [io.github](io.github)
